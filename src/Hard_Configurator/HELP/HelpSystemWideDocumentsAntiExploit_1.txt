<Documents Anti-Exploit> = Adobe
The policy restrictions apply only for Adobe Acrobat Reader XI/DC.
This setting is recommended when MS Office is not installed and other applications are used for managing office documents.

<Documents Anti-Exploit> = OFF
Generally, the system-wide policies can override but do not overwrite non-system-wide restrictions.
The OFF setting removes policy restrictions for MS Office and Adobe Acrobat Reader XI/DC, so the non-system wide restrictions can apply. This setting is also displayed when both MS Office and Adobe Acrobat Reader are not installed. 

<Documents Anti-Exploit> = Partial
This setting is displayed when the policy restrictions were applied via external program (in the HKLM Registry Hive), and do not match predefined Hard_Configurator settings ('Adobe + VBA', 'Adobe', 'OFF'). It is related only to the system-wide restrictions, so it does not show the restrictions made for a particular account via DocumentsAntiExploit tool or from within MS Office and Adobe Acrobat Reader applications.
