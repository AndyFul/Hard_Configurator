<Documents Anti-Exploit> enables/disables some important system-wide protective settings for MS Office and Adobe Acrobat Reader XI/DC applications to mitigate the weaponized documents. This feature works for the desktop versions of MS Office - the versions based on the Universal Windows Platform do ignore this setting. 
In such a case it is possible to use DocumentsAntiExploit tool via SwitchDefaultDeny, and apply the ON2 settings.
 
What <Documents Anti-Exploit> can do:
* VBA interpreter in MS Office is disabled, so VBA Macros (in documents, templates, etc.), VBA  Add-ins, VBA UserForms are blocked. This may have a direct impact on the proper functioning of OLE Automation, Form/ActiveX/COM controls, etc.
* The dangerous features in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC (version from the year 2018 at least) on Windows 8.1/10 can be blocked with the ‘Yellow Message Bar’, and if allowed by the user, then silently mitigated in AppContainer;
* The dangerous features in Adobe Acrobat Reader XI (all Windows versions) and Adobe Acrobat Reader DC (Windows 8 and prior versions) can be blocked with the ‘Yellow Message Bar’ (the user can allow them).
* The restrictions apply as policies for all accounts and override (but not overwrite) applications' native settings in MS Office and Adobe Acrobat Reader XI/DC.
* The restrictions cannot be modified by the user from within MS Office and Adobe Acrobat Reader XI/DC applications. 

<Documents Anti-Exploit> =  Adobe + VBA
This setting is recommended for anyone on Windows 10, who installed MS Office and Adobe Acrobat Reader XI/DC. It provides enhanced protection when supported by Hard_Configurator Recommended Settings (default-deny setup).
The VBA interpreter is disabled for MS Office XP/2003, and higher versions up to MS Office 2019 (Excel, FrontPage, Outlook, PowerPoint, Publisher, and Word). In Adobe Acrobat Reader XI/DC, the important protective features are turned ON.
The users, who require the protection against the 0-day sophisticated malware, may also consider activating Windows Defender ASR rules on Windows 10. 
Hardening MS Office or Adobe Acrobat Reader XI/DC is also possible via DocumentsAntiExploit tool, which is available from SwitchDefaultDeny application. This tool can apply protective features on a particular account (non-system-wide). It is also recommended when the user cannot activate WD ASR rules.
