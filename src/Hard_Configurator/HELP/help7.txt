Setting <Protect Windows Folders> to 'ON' denies the execution from
'C:\Windows' subfolders, that are writable (no UAC protection). 
This protection uses SRP Disallowed rules, so it denies the execution
even if SRP Default Security Level is set to 'Unrestricted'.
The execution is allowed for programs started with Administrative
Rights (or higher) independently of SRP security levels.
