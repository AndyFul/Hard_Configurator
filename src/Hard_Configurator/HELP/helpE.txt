<Forced SmartScreen> button adds/removes ‘Install By SmartScreen’ or ‘Run By SmartScreen’ entry in the right-click Explorer context menu - it works on Windows 8 and higher versions. These entries, force on-demand file execution with SmartScreen check, for files located in UserSpace. If the file is located in SystemSpace (inside 'Windows', 'Program Files ...'), then SmartScreen works as usual (not forced). 

Pressing <Forced SmartScreen> button changes between values:
'Administrator' -> 'Standard User' -> 'OFF'
The setting 'Administrator' corresponds to the "Install By SmartScreen" entry in the right-click Explorer context menu.
The setting 'Standard User' corresponds to the "Run By SmartScreen" entry in the right-click Explorer context menu.
The setting 'OFF' removes "Install By SmartScreen" or "Run By SmartScreen" from the Explorer context menu.

‘Install By SmartScreen’ works as follows:
1. It can check EXE and MSI files (also via shortcuts), and run them if accepted by SmartScreen Application Reputation. All other files are blocked (with notification). 
2. If the EXE / MSI restrictions are lowered by the setting:
   <More SRP ...><Update Mode> = ON
then, ‘Install By SmartScreen’ executes the file (bypassing SRP restrictions) with standard rights.
3. If the EXE / MSI restrictions are not lowered: 
   <More SRP ...><Update Mode> = OFF
then, ‘Install By SmartScreen’ executes the file (bypassing SRP restrictions) with Administrative rights.

On the contrary, the "Run By SmartSreen" entry always executes the file with standard rights.
