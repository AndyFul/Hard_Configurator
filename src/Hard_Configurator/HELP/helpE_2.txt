(A) Keep <Forced SmartScreen> = 'Administrator', when SRP is activated. If so, the users can safely:
1. Run programs (with a mouse click or pressing ENTER button) which have been already installed or put on the Whitelist.
2. Open the media files, documents, and other file types, which are not on the 'Designated File Types' list.
3. Install new programs from UserSpace by using 'Install By SmartScreen' entry from the Explorer context menu (only EXE and MSI files).

(B) Keep <Forced SmartScreen> = 'Standard User' when SRP is deactivated. If so, then ‘Run By SmartScreen’ entry from the Explorer context menu can be used on demand to safely run / open any file.
