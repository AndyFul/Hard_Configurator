<MORE ...> button opens a menu with additional restriction options. 
The numbers on the right of this button, show the actual status of those
restrictions. For example, #1010110 means that the first, third, fifth and
sixth options from additional restrictions are set to 'ON' and others are
set to 'OFF'.
Some options are not marked as recommended, so they do not change
their status when pressing <Recommended Settings> button.
Those options can be used only by advanced users.
