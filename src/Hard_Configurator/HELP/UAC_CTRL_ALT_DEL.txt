<UAC_CTRL_ALT_DEL> setting turns ON/OFF the Secure Attention Sequence (SAS), before User Account Control (UAC) prompt. Instead of being automatically taken to a secure desktop with the UAC elevation prompt, users have to press Ctrl+Alt+Del keystroke combination, before the secure desktop is presented. As the SAS can’t be emulated other than by physically pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del, the user can be sure that the secure desktop is genuine (not simulated by the malware).
The SAS is rather inconvenient (not recommended) if the application elevation is required on a regular basis, but it offers additional protection against malware programs, that can simulate the behavior of common system applications. 

Warning.
This feature sometimes fails to show the SAS prompt, which can have unexpected consequences while updating Windows. It is recommended to turn it off while making Windows Updates.
