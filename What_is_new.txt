Version 5.1.1.2 (stable)
This version is essentially the same as ver. 5.1.1.1, except that DocumentsAntiExploit tool executable was replaced by its

(without Hard_Configurator) to harden MS Office or Adobe Acrobat Reader XI/DC.

Version 5.1.1.1 (stable) 
The main differences from the last stable ver. 5.0.0.0 are included in beta versions : 5.0.0.1, 5.0.1.1, and 5.1.1.1.
There are some minor changes as compared to the latest beta ver. 5.1.1.1:
1. Executables are signed by the new code signing certificate valid until June 2021.
2. Added the tip text feature for some important buttons in ConfigureDefender, DocumentsAntiExploit and FirewallHardening.
3. Updated versions of ConfigureDefender ver. 3.0.0.1, DocumentsAntiExploit ver. 1.0.1.1, FirewallHardening ver. 2.0.0.0, and
RunBySmartScreen 3.1.0.1.

Version beta 5.1.1.1
1. Fixed the GUI bug related to whitelisting by hash.

Version beta 5.0.1.1 
1. Added the integrity module which can check and solve problems when SRP is tampered by another application.
2. Added a quick method to refresh SRP rules.
3. Added the new setting profile Windows_*_Basic_Recommended_Settings.hdc and included it in Hard_Configurator manual.
4. Removed the "All files" SRP Enforcement setting due to possible incompatibilities with 3rd party security solutions. Furthermore,
this setting is not used in Hard_Configurator predefined profiles and it is not well integrated with Recommended Settings on Windows 8+.
5. Improved the SRP rules related to <Update Mode> and <Harden Archivers> (added support for Explzh archiver).
6. Corrected some minor bugs.

Version beta 5.0.0.1
1. The new version of ConfigureDefender 2.1.1.1
Corrected a bug related to the error when "Defender Security Log" is empty. 
Removed event Id=1117 from Defender Security Log.
Extended the maximal number of entries in the Log to 300.
Extended the "Cloud Time Check Limit" in HIGH Protection Level from 10s to 20s. 
2. The new version of FirewallHardening 1.0.1.1 
Added curl.exe to FirewallHardening LolBins, and curl.exe, certutil.exe to FirewallHardening 'Recommended H_C' rules. Removed the bug
related to displaying the last blocked event.
3. The new version of DocumentsAntiExploit tool - improved/corrected the Outlook macro protection.
4. The new version of SwitchDefaultDeny 2.0.0.1 - adjusted to work with <Update Mode>.
5. Changed the name of the H_C option <Run As SmartScreen> to <Forced SmartScreen>.
6. Changed the name "Run As SmartScreen" (of the entry in the Explorer context menu) to "Install By SmartScreen".
7. Added prevention against SmartScreen DLL hijacking (included in "Install By SmartScreen" and "Run By SmartScreen").
8. Added 3 new options <Update Mode>, <Harden Archivers>, and <Harden Email Clients>. The <Update Mode> allows the execution of EXE
(TMP) and MSI files in ProgramData and AppData folders, which allows the applications to auto-update without losing much of the H_C
protection. These folders are hidden for the users in the Explorer default settings. The <Harden Archivers> and <Harden Email Clients>
support the <Update Mode> to prevent bypassing the Hard_Configurator Recommended Settings. The settings <Update Mode> = ON, <Harden
Archivers> = ON, and <Harden Email Clients> = ON are added to the H_C Recommended Settings on Windows 8+.
The <Update Mode> = ON setting still blocks the EXE (TMP) and MSI files in other folders from UserSpace like: Desktop, Documents,
Downloads, Music, Movies, Pictures, non-system partitions, and USB drives. The user has to use "Install By SmartScreen" entry to run
standalone application installers.
9. Added some new H_C setting profiles. For example, the Windows_8_Strict_Recommended_Settings and
Windows_10_Strict_Recommended_Settings apply for Recommended Settings used in H_C 5.0.0.0 and prior versions, which did not use the
<Update Mode> feature.
10. Whitelisted the folder ImplicitAppShortcuts (only for shortcuts).
11. Whitelisted the shortcuts in the user Desktop, when the Desktop location is redirected. This can happen when the user chooses the
Desktop backup in OneDrive or manually changes the path to the Desktop. After changing the path to the user Desktop, it is required to
sign off from the account or refresh the Explorer. After that, the shortcuts on the Desktop in the new location will be automatically
whitelisted.
12. Added to the H_C manual many details related to Recommended Settings and Avast profiles, which can use now the <Update Mode>
feature.
13. Added the option to whitelisting globally the MSI files (<Whitelist By Path> "Allow MSI"). In the version 5.0.0.1, this setting is
used when the user applies the profile "Windows_10_MT_Windows_Security_hardening.hdc" - both EXE (TMP) and MSI files are allowed. In
the old setting profile "Windows_10_MT_Windows_Security_hardening.hdc", only EXE (TMP) files are globally allowed.


Version 5.0.0.0
1. Added new version of ConfigureDefender with additional ASR rule: "Block persistence through WMI event subscription".
2. Minor bugs corrected.

Version 4.1.1.1
1. Added "Paranoid Extensions" (259 potentially dangerous file type extensions).
2. Added FirewallHardening tool, which blocks by Windows Firewall many LOLBins and allows the user to block any application.
3. Removed explorer.exe paths from FirewallHardening LOLBins on Windows 8 and 8.1., for compatibility with SmartScreen.
4. Two buttons <Recommended SRP> and <Recommended Restrictions> are replaced by one green button <Recommended Settings>.
5. Reorganization of buttons: the violet buttons <Firewall Hardening> and <ConfigureDefender> are now located in the upper part of the
main window. The button <No Removable Disks Exec.> was replaced by the new option button <Validate Admin Code Signatures> (see point 7).
6. If Default Deny Protection is turned OFF by 'Switch Default Deny' tool,  then "Run By SmartScreen" option is automatically enabled in 
Explorer context menu. It can be used for installing safely the applications both on Administrator and Standard User type of accounts.
7. Added the option <Validate Admin Code Signatures> which changes the UAC settings to enforce cryptographic signatures on any interactive
application that requests elevation of privilege. This setting will prevent the user to run from Explorer the applications which require
Administrative rights, but are not digitally signed.
8. Added the profile "Windows_10_MT_Windows_Security_hardening.hdc" which uses the new option <Validate Admin Code Signatures>.
9. The option <Restore Windows Defaults> does restore also Windows Defender defaults and removes FirewallHardening Outbound block rules.
10. All Hard-Configurator native executables are digitally signed by SHA256 certificate (Certum Code Signing CA SHA2).
