REMARKS

After Hard_Configurator uninstallation:
1. The registry values tweaked by Hard_Configurator are set to Windows defaults!!!
2. The System Restore is turned ON. It is good to keep this setting ON, when installing security programs. If not required, it can be 
manually turned OFF, using the Control Panel or running the Windows tool --> SystemPropertiesProtection.exe  .
3. The DocumentsAntiExploit tool is copied to the Public Desktop, and it is available for managing the MS Office and Adobe Acrobat 
Reader XI/DC settings on the particular account. Do not delete it, until you are sure that its protection is turned OFF, on all user
accounts.
